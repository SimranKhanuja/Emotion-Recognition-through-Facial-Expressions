# Emotion-Recognition-through-Facial-Expressions

Implemented facial expression recognition by extracting and selecting across various geometrical features and compared differences 
with a neutral expression.

This is inspired from the 2015 article published in the IJMUE, by Deepak Ghimire titled, "Recognition of Facial Expressions Based
on Tracking and Selection of Discriminative Geometric Features."
