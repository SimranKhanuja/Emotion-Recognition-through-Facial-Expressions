# Emotion-Recognition-through-Facial-Expressions

Implemented facial expression recognition by selecting features across various geometrical features and comparing differences 
with a neutral expression.

It is a person dependant module at present.

This is inspired from the 2015 article published in the IJMUE, by Deepak Ghimire titled, "Recognition of Facial Expressions Based on Tracking and Selection of Discriminative Geometric Features."
